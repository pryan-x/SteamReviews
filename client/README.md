## Steam Review

Steam Review is a react app. In this app, one calls the steam api, the store and the web api. One can add a game id, which is done by running a search through the steam store api depending on their input value. Then, the result that is picked is recorded into a mock api, specifically, the game's app id. Then one is redirected to the gallery page where all the appids of the mock api are presented as game cards, where they can be deleted if one wishes. When one picks a game card they are redirected to a page where the appid is used to call the store page api of the game. The data of the game is presented, such as price, developer, publisher, genre tags, about informations, and screenshots. 

I plan on adding a functionality to post reviews of the games added to the mock api.
